    I used the <strong>No-Sew Sunflower Pillow</strong> as a guide. You can get the pattern for free 
    on <a href="https://wondercrochet.blog/no-sew-sunflower-pillow-free-crochet-pattern/"

    Besides the written pattern, she also has an instructional video on

      I used leftovers of the jumbo yellow yarn from my dino adventure 🦖 for the petails. The bulky brown yarn
       for the center came from one of my Value Village “mysterious bags” (and it was a pain to disentangle!). 
       Worked all with a <strong>9 mm crochet hook</strong>. I stuffed the petals with polyfill, and for 
       the center I used whatever was left of the mysterious brown yarn.😅</p>

    My flower ended up a little bigger with 12 petals instead of 10. Because of this I had to also make a larger center circle. 
    But I just added a couple of more rows to the original instructions and it was fine.😉 My finished pillow is about 25 inches across (the original pattern is around 19 inches).  </p>
