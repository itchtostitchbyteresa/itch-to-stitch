    For this autumn wreath I used the Fabulous Fall Wreath as inspiration. You can get the pattern 
    for free on <a href="https://www.yarnspirations.com/en-ca/products/red-heart-fabulous-fall-wreath"

      For the frame, I used a simple <strong>metal wreath ring, 14 inches in diameter.</strong> 
      I grabbed mine at Dollarama, but you can find similar ones on 
      <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Firlar-Wreath-Valentines-Wedding-Decoration/dp/B08T1M46N5/ref=asc_df_B08T1M46N5?mcid=1dd068fdea34393c9e1323b4495383e9&tag=googleshopc0c-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=706725854862&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11067853612871393448&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9198282&hvtargid=pla-2321882202954&hvocijid=11067853612871393448-B08T1M46N5-&hvexpln=0&gad_source=1&th=1" target="_blank" class="underline text-rose-700 hover:text-rose-900">Amazon.ca</a>, or any online craft shop.
      To cover it, I used a bulky cream yarn I’d found in a “mystery savings bag” at Value Village.😁I simply wrapped it all
    the way around the ring until it was covered. You could also crochet stitches around the frame if you prefer; 
    the only thing that matters is that the entire base disappears under yarn so you have something solid.

<p>For yarn, I used <strong>Loops & Threads Impeccable</strong> leftovers: <em>Red Hot, Pumpkin, Golden Beige, Forest, 
Lemon, Sunny Day,</em> and <em>Green Lagoon.</em> I worked everything with a <strong>4.5 mm hook</strong>. I didn’t bother 
with gauge or matching the exact sizes from the inspiration pattern. 
I just made a leaf, liked how it looked, and kept going from there.😅 </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
    My wreath has more of the <strong>five-point </strong> leaves and the <strong>grape </strong> leaves, and fewer of 
    the <strong>single-point</strong> style. That made it look a little busier than the original recipe. I wanted it to feel 
    full and slightly wild, like a bundle of real leaves. You know, messy.🙃You could make different 
    choices with your leaf mix to get a tidier look more close to the original if that’s what you prefer. For the <strong>acorns
    and the larger grapes</strong>, I used leftover yarn scraps, but you can use any filling you have on hand. I hot  glued some of the 
    leafs to the base and sew the rest on top of each other.
